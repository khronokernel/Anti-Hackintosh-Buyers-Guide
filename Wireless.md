For wireless, keep in mind that macOS has a very limited selection for native Wifi and Bluetooth cards but Midi has a great list on supported models that you can find in the [r/Hackintosh FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/wiki/faq#wiki_wifi_compatibility). But for those who are either motherboard shopping or just looking for dedicated wireless will need to keep in mind that the following wireless cards are not supported:

**Wireless cards that aren't supported AT ALL**

* Any Intel based wireless(Bluetooth sometimes works but it's inconcistent and seems to be on a per system basis)
* Any Killer based wireless

**Wireless cards to avoid**

* Any USB based(Ralink and Realtek) as these generally aren't as reliable and some macOS functions like Hand-Off and AppleWatch Unlock may not function correctly
